# Swarm Intelligence for Next Generation Healthcare

This report explores the application of Swarm Intelligence (SI) and Swarm Learning (SL) in modern healthcare environments. It addresses real-world challenges such as data fragmentation, staff turnover, and privacy concerns, and proposes adaptive, decentralized AI solutions. The report includes two case studies: dynamic patient visit segmentation and anonymization of 3D medical imaging data, demonstrating practical uses of SI/SL in clinical settings.
